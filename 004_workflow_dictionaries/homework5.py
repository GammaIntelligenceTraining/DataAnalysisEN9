# Task 1: The Stubborn Door
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a password.
# Keep asking them for the password while their input does not match "open sesame".
# Once they type the correct password, print "Access granted!" 
# and end the program.

# Hint: You will need a variable to store the user's input before the loop starts,
# and you will need to update that same variable inside the loop.




# Task 2: The Safe Divider
# Write a program that asks the user for two numbers.
# Divide the first number by the second number and print the result.
# Wrap your code in a try...except block to catch the ZeroDivisionError that
# happens if the user enters 0 for the second number.

# Sample Output (Success): "10 divided by 2 is 5.0"
# Sample Output (Error handled): "Error: You cannot divide a number by zero!"



# Task 3: The Vowel Counter
# Create a variable with the string text = "python programming is fun".
# Create a vowel_count variable and set it to 0.
# Loop through every letter in the text using a for loop.
# If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add 1 to your counter. 
# Print the final count at the very end.



# Task 4: The VIP Bouncer
# You have a list of guests: guests = ["Alice", "Bob", "VIP_Charlie", "Dave", "VIP_Eve"].
# Loop through the list. If the guest's name starts with "VIP_", print "Welcome to the lounge, [Name]!".
# Otherwise, print "Enjoy the main floor, [Name].".

# Hint: You can check if a string starts with a specific word by
# using slicing or the .startswith() string method.

guests = ["Alice", "Bob", "VIP_Charlie", "Dave", "VIP_Eve"]



# Task 5 *: Find the Champion (Without shortcuts)
# You have a list of scores: scores = [45, 88, 72, 95, 33, 81].
# Without using Python's built-in max() function, find the highest score.
scores = [45, 88, 72, 95, 33, 81]
