# Write a program that:
#
# 1. Calculates the age using the given data (current_year – the current year,
#    year_of_birth – the year of birth)
# 2. Find the missing part of the code (code_2):
#    - find the remainder of x divided by y
#    - multiply the obtained result by 13
#    - extract the square root of the result (equivalent to raising it to the power of 0.5)
#    - take the integer part of the result
# 3. Combine the code into a separate variable
#    example:
#    475-12-967
# 4. Output a string using the available variables:
#    example:
#    Hello Mary Gold. You are 26 years old. Your secret code is 475-12-967.


# years
current_year = 2023
year_of_birth = 1988

# code parts
code_1 = '354'
code_3 = 132

# name
user_name = 'John'
user_surname = 'Smith'

# code 2 data
x = 152
y = 132

age = current_year - year_of_birth

code_2 = int((x % y * 13) ** 0.5)

# code_2 = math.sqrt(x % y * 13)

code = code_1 + "-" + str(code_2) + "-" + str(code_3)

print("Hello " + user_name + " " + user_surname + ". You are " + str(age) +
      " years old. Your secret code is " + code + ".")
